WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a prototype for a to-be mobile app to find the best path in a store, given its layout, such that:
- The softer items in the cart do not get crushed by the harder and heavier items
- The user has to walk the minimum

This prototype is written in C++ and uses the OpenGL graphics API for visuals.
